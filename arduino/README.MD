#Arduino Quick Start Guide

What is an Arduino? This is an Arduino:

An Arduino is a very simple computer. It doesn't have a monitor or keyboard, and it can only store and run one app (or program) at a time. You can write a program for it using your normal big computer by connecting it with a USB cable. Once you've saved your program to the Arduino, you can disconnect the cable and just run it on batteries.

The Arduino has a lot of input and output pins you can connect wires to, and it's good at controlling simple things like motors, lights, speakers and sensors. That's why it's perfect for making interactive holiday decorations for an event like Tech the Halls!

In order to write a program for the Arduino, you'll first need to download a special piece of software called the Arduino IDE. IDE means `Integrated Development Environment` and it's just a program that lets you write programs and send them to the Arduino.

##Install the Arduino IDE

The following link has a version of the Arduino IDE Software for Windows, Mac and Linux:

Please download and install the Arduino IDE software that's appropriate for the computer you're using. If you're not sure how to install software, ask one of our volunteers to help you out!

Once you've finished installing, be sure to start the Arduino IDE so that you're ready for the next step.

##Connect the Arduino to your PC

Using the provided USB cable connect the Arduino just like this:
